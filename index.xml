We also wanted to get a better grasp on what marriage is for and do a deep gut check that we actually want to marry each other (spoiler: we do!).
I started out by looking for books that would teach me about how great relationships work, and had a hard time finding the information I wanted.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://nicolezok.com/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nicolezok.com/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hey world,
As you can tell, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a blog. My immediate reason for doing this is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying relationships (and marriage in particular) for the past year or so, and wanted to have a place to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about that. I expect having a blog will also have the benefit of helping me think more clearly by forcing me to write things down. I think this is enough of a starting point, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see where it goes :)</description></item></channel></rss>
