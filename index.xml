As you can tell, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a blog. My immediate reason for doing this is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying relationships (and marriage in particular) for the past year or so, and wanted to have a place to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about that. I expect having a blog will also have the benefit of helping me think more clearly by forcing me to write things down. I think this is enough of a starting point, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see where it goes :)</description></item></channel></rss>
