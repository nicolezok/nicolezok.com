I was with a friend and we were in transition between two activities. I noticed I felt like I needed something before we started the next activity, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t immediately sure what it was, so I said &amp;ldquo;I HAVE AN UNMET NEED.&amp;rdquo; Friend laughed, I spent 30 seconds figuring out what my unmet need was (I was cold) and how to fix it (make tea).</description></item><item><title>Some relationship models, how they interact, and my best guesses at what to do about the problems they're pointing at</title><link>https://nicolezok.com/posts/some-relationship-models-how-they-interact-and-my-best-guesses-at-what-to-do-about-the-problems-they-re-pointing-at/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nicolezok.com/posts/some-relationship-models-how-they-interact-and-my-best-guesses-at-what-to-do-about-the-problems-they-re-pointing-at/</guid><description>For the past year or so, Kyle and I have been doing an in-depth study of relationships (and ours in particular), with a goal of enabling us to have the best relationship we can have with each other. We also wanted to get a better grasp on what marriage is for and do a deep gut check that we actually want to marry each other (spoiler: we do!).
I started out by looking for books that would teach me about how great relationships work, and had a hard time finding the information I wanted.</description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://nicolezok.com/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Oct 2020 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://nicolezok.com/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>Hey world,
As you can tell, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a blog. My immediate reason for doing this is because I&amp;rsquo;ve been studying relationships (and marriage in particular) for the past year or so, and wanted to have a place to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning about that. I expect having a blog will also have the benefit of helping me think more clearly by forcing me to write things down. I think this is enough of a starting point, so we&amp;rsquo;ll see where it goes :)</description></item></channel></rss>
