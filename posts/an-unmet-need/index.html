I noticed I felt like I needed something before we started the next activity, but wasn&rsquo;t immediately sure what it was, so I said &ldquo;I HAVE AN UNMET NEED.&rdquo; Friend laughed, I spent 30 seconds figuring out what my unmet need was (I was cold) and how to fix it (make tea). Doing this process out loud was surprisingly helpful. Maybe because it made me more likely to figure out what the need was and meet it, by making it known that I was in the middle of a thought process so I didn&rsquo;t feel pressured to either figure it out quickly or drop it, and had more working memory that I could focus on figuring out what my need was rather than thinking about the social situation (an expectation that we were moving to a new activity). Sharing the experience with my friend also felt like it was good for our relationship, so it was great all around. I feel proud about this.</p><p>I really value being in environments where I can say things like this and want there to be more of those types of environments.</p></div><hr class=post-end><footer class=post-info><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-file-text"><path d="M14 2H6A2 2 0 004 4v16a2 2 0 002 2h12a2 2 0 002-2V8z"/><polyline points="14 2 14 8 20 8"/><line x1="16" y1="13" x2="8" y2="13"/><line x1="16" y1="17" x2="8" y2="17"/><polyline points="10 9 9 9 8 9"/></svg>221 Words</p><p><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-calendar"><rect x="3" y="4" width="18" height="18" rx="2" ry="2"/><line x1="16" y1="2" x2="16" y2="6"/><line x1="8" y1="2" x2="8" y2="6"/><line x1="3" y1="10" x2="21" y2="10"/></svg>2021-02-20 08:00 +0000</p></footer></article><div class="post-nav thin"><a class=next-post href=https://nicolezok.com/posts/i-think-maybe-the-introvert-extrovert-scale-is-bad/><span class=post-nav-label><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="feather feather-arrow-left"><line x1="19" y1="12" x2="5" y2="12"/><polyline points="12 19 5 12 12 5"/></svg>&nbsp;Newer</span><br><span>I think maybe the introvert/extrovert scale is bad</span></a>
