Hey world,

As you can tell, I've created a blog. My immediate reason for doing this is because I've been studying relationships (and marriage in particular) for the past year or so, and wanted to have a place to share what I've been learning about that. I expect having a blog will also have the benefit of helping me think more clearly by forcing me to write things down. I think this is enough of a starting point, so we'll see where it goes :)
